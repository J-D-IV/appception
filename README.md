# Appception
[Appception](https://appception.azurewebsites.net) is a web app generator. It allows you to forget about complicated setup and start coding your web app now.

Starting a new application, juggling web, terminal, and text interfaces, is confusing and tedious and frustrating. Appception replaces that experience with a turnkey solution that creates a working, deployed app from nothing fast.

Really fast.

## Usage
If you want to use Appception, we recommend you check out the [Appception website](https://appception.azurewebsites.net). You'll need a GitHub account to log in.

Once you log in, you'll see a list of your current GitHub projects. You can __select a project/branch__ or __create a new project__ using one of our generators.

Either way, you're going to end up the file editor! From there just make changes, save, and __commit__. Easy!

Oh! Did we mention that your project will be __automatically deployed__ on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)?!


## Requirements

All other dependencies are installed with ```npm```, ```bower```, or ```grunt```.
