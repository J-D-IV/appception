## Random group of Ideas ##
	- Allow automatic cloning of repo to desktop
	- Auto push and pull on desktop
	- CSS templates (bootstrap, material design)
	- Ability to have personal templates (I like to have my SASS files set up a certain way, would be cool to be able to store that somewhere and pull it up later)

## Aaron's Additions ##
  - Visual code folding: code blocks colored / divs with dynamic collapsing?
  - Tree / Graph dataviz of function calls
  - ? could dataviz allow you to hook up one function call to a chunk of code?
  - ? Hybrid view of function calls and physical file space?
  - Draw HTML elements dynamically: create code as you draw, show element as you type.
