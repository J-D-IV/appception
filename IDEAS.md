## Random group of Ideas ##
	- Allow automatic cloning of repo to desktop
	- Auto push and pull on desktop
	- CSS templates (bootstrap, material design)
	- Ability to have personal templates (I like to have my SASS files set up a certain way, would be cool to be able to store that somewhere and pull it up later)
