Deploy Pages TODO:

* Check to see if user has a project named:
  username.github.io

* IF NOT: Create a USER PAGE.
  * This is a repo with the following format:
    username.github.io

* NOTE: Auto Page Generator here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator

* To make PROJECT PAGES (https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages):
  * Project repo must have the branch:
    gh-pages

  * URL for page is
    http://username.github.io/projectname
    https://username.github.io/projectname
  * 


  OPTIONS:
  1) Can make default branch 'gh-pages'
  2) THEN send to GH page creator...?
  3) I think this accomplishes what we need...
